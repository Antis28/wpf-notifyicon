1.0.1
*****
CHG   DataContext is also assigned to ContextMenu, and properly coerced for
      ToolTips and Popups. Also checks whether target item has a binding
      on the DataContext (does not just override if DataContext is null).
CHG   The LeftClickCommand now executes with a delay in order to mak sure
      it's not a double-click.
FIX   Removed debug output in WindowMessageSink.
