1.0.1
*****
CHG   DataContext is also assigned to ContextMenu (thanks Nic Pilllinger),
      and properly coerced for ToolTips and Popups. Also checks whether
      target item has a binding on the DataContext
      (does not just override if DataContext is null).
CHG   Popup creation no longer calls Popup.CreateRootPopup which tries to
      bind to dependency properties that do not exist, thus causing debug
      warnings (thanks to Loic Berthollet).
CHG   The LeftClickCommand now executes with a delay in order to make sure
      it's not a double-click.
FIX   Removed debug output in WindowMessageSink.
