1.0.1
*****
CHG   DataContext is also assigned to ContextMenu, and properly coerced for
      ToolTips and Popups. Also checks whether target item has a binding
      on the DataContext (does not just override if DataContext is null).
      Thanks Nic Pilllinger for pointing this one out.
CHG   Popup creation no longer calls Popup.CreateRootPopup which tries to
      bind to dependency properties that do not exist, thus causing debug
      warnings. Thanks to Loic Berthollet for the hint.
CHG   The LeftClickCommand now executes with a delay in order to mak sure
      it's not a double-click.
FIX   Removed debug output in WindowMessageSink.
